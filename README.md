# Prooferator
Arduino-controlled "proofing" box for bread dough

This project arose from a need for a constant temperature warm (but not hot) environment in which to let sourdough bread "proof" - i.e., grow, rise, mature, etc.  It's made from simple stuff I had lying around the house, mostly:
- an Igloo picnic cooler
- a 12V, 15W automotive light bulb
- an Arduino equipped with a DS18S20 temperature Sensor and a relay module to run a servo control of the temperature (i.e., a thermostat)

I also created a Python-based GUI (using PyQt5) to monitor the temperature and change the set point.
